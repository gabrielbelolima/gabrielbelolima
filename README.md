# About me
I'm mainly a business student who found out about data while studying statistics (coded two lines in R...:laught:) and immediately decided to become a Data Scientist. I'm from Brazil and actually I'm working as a Data Science trainee in a payment technology company as part of the Artificial Intelligence squad, which is mostly focused on finding solutions and implementing technologies for retail players. Nowadays I use Python a lot, but I'm totally interested in learning all kinds of tools and languages to help me extract the best from data and from myself. I've been trying to get in touch with different areas, so I went from NLP, time series forecasting, recommendation systems for retail to simple EDA's (or not this simple EDA's...), and I've loved all of these. So, If I can help you, count on me. If you can help me, don't hesitate for a moment! :facepunch:
