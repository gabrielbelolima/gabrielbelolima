# About me
I'm mainly a business student who found out about data while studying statistics (coded two lines in R...:laughting:) and immediately decided to become a Data Scientist. I'm from Brazil and actually I'm working as a Data Science trainner in a payment tecnology company as part of the Artificial Inteligence squad, which is mostly focused in finding solutions and implementing tecnologies for retail players. Nowadays I use Python a lot, but I'm totaly interested in learning all kind of tools and languages to help me extract the best from data and from myself. I've been trying to get in touch with different areas, so I went from NLP, timeseries forecasting, recommendation systems for retail to simple EDA's (or not this simple EDA's...), and i've loved all of these. So, If I can help you, count on me, if you can help me, don't you exitate for a moment! :facepunch:
