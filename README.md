# About me
I am a Brazilian Data Scientist working as a Business Intelligence Analyst. I'm not really engaged in creating personal projects seemed I already work a lot, but It's always great to find inspiration and time to build something new. Right now I'm working mainly with PowerBI and data visualization in general (a SQL-Python-PowerBI routine) but I will try and bring some ML projects and Data Analysis in general. So, anyone who needs assistance (as I needed some time ago) can maybe find it here. I'm always open to talking or helping in whatever way I can, so feel free to DM me!   :facepunch:
