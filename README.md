# About me
I am a Brazilian Data Scientist working as a Business Intelligence Analyst. Right now I'm working mainly with PowerBI and data visualization in general (a SQL-Python-PowerBI routine) but I will try and bring some ML or Data Analysis projects in general. So, anyone in need of assistance (as I needed some time ago) can maybe find it here. I'm always open to talking or helping in whatever way I can, so feel free to DM me! 😁

## Interests

* Statistics (even the parts I don't get.😅)
* Data visualization 
* Data related Tutorials (any kind of tutorial catches my eyes, to be honest! :eyes:) 
* Books
* ML applications
* Learning
* Teaching
* Fat cats
* The Zelda series :cupid:
* Music (I love synthesizers!:alien:)
